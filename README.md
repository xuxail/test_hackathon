## üöÄ Project Overview

**Team Name:** ThermalCore Labs  
**Hackathon Category:** Hardware & Systems  
**Track:** Innovative Computing Solutions

### Problem Statement

Modern data centers face a dual performance crisis:

CPU Overhead from Software Scheduling: Traditional OS schedulers like Linux CFS consume 5-15% of CPU cycles just for scheduling decisions, with latencies ranging from 1-10ms. This overhead scales poorly - Google's research shows that software schedulers create performance jitter and waste valuable CPU cycles that could be used for actual computation.
Thermal Management Blind Spot: Current schedulers lack real-time thermal awareness, creating hotspots that trigger CPU throttling and reduce performance by 15-30%. The thermal feedback loop is too slow (100ms+ response time) to prevent damage.

The Core Issue: Every scheduling decision made in software steals CPU cycles from your applications. In high-frequency trading, microservices, and HPC workloads, this overhead is devastating to performance.
### Our Solution: Hardware-Accelerated Thermal Scheduling

Inspired by Google's Coriolis research (achieving <1Œºs scheduling latency) and Microsoft's Catapult project (95% performance improvements), we propose a dedicated Microwatt PowerPC coprocessor that:

Eliminates CPU Overhead: Moves all thermal scheduling logic to dedicated hardware, freeing up 5-15% of host CPU cycles for applications
Achieves Sub-Millisecond Response: Hardware scheduling with <500Œºs latency vs 1-10ms software scheduling
Real-time Thermal Awareness: Continuous thermal monitoring and prediction impossible with software-only solutions
Predictable Performance: Eliminates scheduling jitter that plagues software schedulers

Expected Impact: Following industry research patterns, we anticipate 20-30% overall system performance improvement through the combination of eliminated CPU scheduling overhead and optimized thermal management.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### High-Level Design

The system comprises a Host Server interacting with a Microwatt Coprocessor to offload and optimize thermal-aware scheduling.

### Data Flow

1.  **Collection:** Host gathers CPU temperature, power, and utilization data from `/sys/class/thermal/`, `/proc/stat`, and RAPL interfaces.
2.  **Transmission:** Telemetry is sent to the Microwatt coprocessor via PCIe DMA (or UDP for prototype).
3.  **Processing:** The OpenPOWER core on the coprocessor executes advanced scheduling algorithms, incorporating real-time thermal prediction.
4.  **Decision:** Optimized task placement decisions are returned to the host.
5.  **Application:** The Linux scheduler applies these decisions using `sched_setaffinity()` or cgroups.
